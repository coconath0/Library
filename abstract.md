# Abstract: Library Resource Optimization Strategy

**Title:** Beyond Books: Aligning Library Infrastructure with the "New Normal" of Student Usage

**Problem Statement:**
University enrollment is growing, but physical library circulation is declining. This project investigates whether this decline is a temporary COVID anomaly or a permanent behavioral shift, and how the library should adapt its physical footprint in response.

**Methods:**
We analyzed 10 years of circulation data (FY2014–FY2024) alongside IPEDS enrollment figures. Using Python, we developed a "Circulation Velocity" metric to measure per-capita usage and applied a time-series forecast (linear trend analysis on the FY21–FY24 recovery baseline) to predict demand for FY2025–2026.

**Results:**
The data reveals a structural "Engagement Gap": while enrollment has hit record highs, physical book usage per student has fallen by ~25% since 2020. However, a "Hardware Flip" is occurring: demand for laptops and equipment has surged 66% in the last three years. Our predictive model forecasts that total circulation will stabilize at ~64,000 annual transactions rather than returning to pre-pandemic highs.

**Implications (Prescriptive):**
Based on these findings, we propose a "Resource Reallocation Strategy." Using a growth-share matrix, we identified underutilized collections (DVDs, Juvenile) that should be archived to reclaim floor space. We recommend repurposing this space into "Tech Lending Hubs" to support the growing demand for digital infrastructure, aligning the library's physical assets with modern student needs.
